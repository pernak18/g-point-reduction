    "1. Set some runtime variables that tell us about our configuration -- what spectral domain are we plotting, what cost function and normalization technique are we using, what _g_-points are we combining (only adjacent _g_-points are combined in a given iteration, so only the first _g_-point needs to be assigned)\n",
    "2. Grab corresponding _k_-distribution file (provided by Menno and stored in Rick's scratch space) and stage it for RRTMGP\n",
    "3. Link to the RRTMGP driver for Garand atmospheres (stored in E3SM project space)\n",
    "4. Copy the LBLRTM reference netCDF into the working directory (its gas optics parameters will be used in the model). Also, apparently Menno and I have been modeling with a non-optimized diffusivity angle. One angle is used in RRMTGP, but for this exercise we should be using the 3 from Gaussian Quadrature. So we have to replace the `angle` parameter before running RRTMGP.\n",
